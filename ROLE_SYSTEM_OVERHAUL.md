## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Discord-Like Interface
1. **Sidebar Navigation**: Settings organized in left sidebar
2. **Role Hierarchy Visualization**: Visual role order with drag-and-drop
3. **Permission Categories**: Permissions grouped logically
4. **Member Categorization**: Members sorted by role hierarchy
5. **Status Indicators**: Real-time online/offline status

### Color System
- **Role Colors**: Custom hex colors for each role
- **Member Names**: Colored by highest role
- **Role Badges**: Colored badges showing member roles
- **Status Dots**: Color-coded online status indicators

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Role System Architecture
```typescript
interface Role {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  color: string;
  position: number;
  hoisted: boolean;      // Display separately
  mentionable: boolean;  // Can be @mentioned
  permissions: PermissionOverride[];
  memberCount: number;
}

interface Member {
  id: string;
  user: User;
  roles: Role[];         // Member's assigned roles
}
```

### Permission System
- **Granular Permissions**: Based on Discord's permission model
- **Role-Based**: Permissions inherited from roles
- **User Overrides**: Direct user permission overrides
- **Hierarchy Respect**: Higher roles override lower ones

### Real-Time Updates
- **Socket Integration**: Real-time member status updates
- **Role Changes**: Live role assignment/removal
- **Member Updates**: Automatic sidebar refresh
